The centered shapes     abstract from the idea of teeth, talons, or claws, grinding in hopeless tension, drawing from the domestic despair      and neurotic spitballing present in the texts. Something beautiful emerges from the negative space and the       collective form of the shapes, just like with the language. The type draws on Greek influence.","2) More neutral, the idea for this design is a chaotic scaffolding around an ordered architecture of thought. The     scribbles relate to the handwritten text and to the personal touches of a journal.","3) This design with the staircase hints at the duality of possible reads for the disorienting text. The type     selection is simple, allowing the zigzagging lines of the steps to dominate the visual language. The torn paper     and the staples gesture at the intensely personal, autobiographical nature of the works, and also at a kind of frantic     necessity to get words down on paper."],images:[]},{src:i.p+"static/media/Posters.8eeff036.png",id:"Posters",title:"Posters and Compositional Exercises",description:["For the Mass Incarceration poster I researched Mass Incarceration in the US and wrote the poster text,     placing hard-hitting facts at the beginning.
