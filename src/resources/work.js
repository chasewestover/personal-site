  description: `Warbler is a Twitter clone utilizing Flask, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy, on the back-end and Jinja templating, jQuery, and Axios on the front-end. I built this application off of a semi-functioning clone.

My main roles were to fix bugs in the user profile, logout, and homepage routes, add profile editing functionality, and add the ability to like a Warble. I also added extensive testing, including model and view unit tests.

This project allowed me to work with a large codebase written primarily by others. It helped me understand object oriented programming and design and improved my backend testing abilities.`,
